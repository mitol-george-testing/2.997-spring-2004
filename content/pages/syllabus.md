Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Topic Coverage
--------------

Topic coverage will be adapted according to students' interests. Some or all of the following will be covered:

Markov Decision Processes and Dynamic Programming (2-3 weeks)

*   Stochastic Models, Dynamic Programming Theory, Value and Policy Iteration.

Simulation-Based Methods (2 weeks)

*   Asynchronous Value and Policy Iteration, Q-Learning, Complexity of Reinforcement Learning. Revision of underlying tools such as Lyapunov Function Analysis and the ODE Approach.

Value Function Approximation (4 weeks)

*   TD-Learning, Approximate Linear Programming, Performance Bounds, Theory of Function Approximation.

Policy Search Methods (2-3 weeks)

*   Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic Methods. Complexity of Policy Search.

Online Learning and Games (2 weeks)
